This environment contains all files related to the Service developed for EduShare, excepting virtual environment. 
Python environment has installed flask, socket.io, requests, bocadillo, 

Friday, November 29, 2019 19:00 - Created edu-env (python virtual env for edushare) using Visual Studio 2017.

Saturday, January 18, 2020 19:47 - Server now provides access to Login, Sign-Up and Search ports. All ports respond in JSON; formatted as follows:

Login (/edushare/api/v1.0/<username>/<password>) - if successful (user exists and correct credentials used) returns a JSON with user credentials (id, name, email and password). If unsuccessful, it returns a json with error: not found.

Sign-Up (/edushare/api/v1.0/register/<username>/<password>/<email>) - if successful (no security integrity protocols yet implemented for this procedure) returns a JSON with user credentials (id, name, email and password). If unsuccessful, it returns a json with error: not found.

Local Search (/edushare/api/v1.0/search/<search term>) - returns a JSON containing files (items) with tags that match search term. If there are no matching files, it returns JSON error not found.

API Search (/edushare/api/v1.0/apisearch/<search>) - returns a JSON the first page with a collection of matching items from Google Scholar, Mayan-EDMs, Open KM and Wikipedia (so far). It also contains links to previous and next page. All link items have useful information like Author, site published, article type, etc.)

Sunday, January 19, 2020 - Started working on chat. 

There are currently two different chat files with two slightly different approaches:

chat.py - attempting to implement just socket.io according to documentation provided by developers @ https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/server.html#

chatapp.py - attempting to implement socket.io using Bocadillo according to 
		@ https://bocadilloproject.github.io/how-to/socketio.html#planning

Sunday, January 19, 2020 - Bocadillo is now UNMAINTAINED. Users are recommended to migrate to a supported alternative, such as Starlette or FastAPI. chatapp.py will not execute using bocadillo.

Thursday, January 19, 2020 - Started pushing python files to docker for easier remote access. Keep the steps in mind for updating docker repositories:

docker build -t <image name> .
docker login
docker tag <image name> dmss/edushare:<tag>
docker push dmss/edushare:<tag>

Running image:
docker run -p <implemented port>:<replacement port> <image name>

Pulling image:
docker image pull [OPTIONS] dmss/edushare[:<tag>|@DIGEST]

Current image names -- > tag names:
edusharemain [implemented on port 80]--> server_version1
edusharechat [implemented on port 50]--> chat_version1

Saturday, January 25, 2020 - Added code for encryption and decryption (check https://github.com/ijl20/python_java_crypto)

Key= 'neVEraSkeDaNIgGaFOsh!T,ThATiSSAfetOsAy!'
Salt = 'whAtYOuCAlLabiTChWHoDonTsuCkdIcK,YADOnT'

EduShare Server now grabs next 10 and previous 10 results on request...

Completed a Django version of Edushare Services that can be publicly available at host https://edushare-services.herokuapp.com (V2.X). EduShare2.0 uses Heroku for deployment

Heroku Logn:
heroku login

Heroku Pull:
heroku git:clone -a edushare-services
cd edushare-services

Heroku Push/Deploy Commands:
git add .
git commit -m "Update"
git push heroku master
heroku config:set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAQULRDITEAEEKQKW4 AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=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 S3_BUCKET=edushare-filestorage AES_ACCESS_KEY=neVEraSkeDaNIgGaFOsh!TThATiSSAfetOsAy! AES_SALT=whAtYOuCAlLabiTChWHoDonTsuCkdIcKYADOnT

Other Commands:
heroku ps:scale web=1 (use 0 to stop publishing)

EduServices2.1 uses parameters and requires the Key to access user functions. This is the first step to improving edushare client/service data encryption with AES.
